<button class="accordion">Reykjavik, Iceland</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Iceland is one of the safest places for single travellers especially female travellers. On top of it being extremely safe for me to travel there alone I think Iceland is breathtaking. Reykjavik is the captiol of Iceland and I have done extensive research on it, there are around 200,000 people and as it is the largest city in Iceland it has many tourist attractions.

<button class="accordion">Tokyo, Japan</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>For a long time I have dreamed of going to Japan, I focus on Tokyo as I am in love with big cities and I think I would be able to find many things to explore. Specifically I want to try REAL sushi as it is my favourite food. I have watched many YouTube videos as well touring Japan and follow influncers who live there I think it is a stunning city.

  <p>My grandparents have travelled every year my entire life, when they went to Rome my grandmother brought me back a necklace and showed me pictures of their trip, I fell in love instantly. She told me how much I would enjoy it and after that it has been on my bucket list since I was seven.
    Below is a video I found on YouTube showing Rome.

  <p>Munich is an amazing city for learning about World War II, as I am very interested in that topic I think visting Munich would be an amazing experience.
